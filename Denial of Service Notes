Denial of Service
DoS is an attack on a computer that reduces, restircts or prevents accessibility of system resources to legitimate users.

DDoS: Distributed DoS, involves multitude of compromised systems.

Botnet: Bots are soft apps/trojans that run automated tasks over internet.

Volumetric Attacks
    consume all bandwidth of network
    types:
        UDP flood attack: send spoofed udp packets at high rate. results in ICMP error reply
        ICMP flood attack: send large volume of ICMP echo req packet. to protect set threshold limit
        smurf attack: attacker spoofs source IP with victim IP address and sends large number of ICMP echo request packets to IP broadcast system.
        Pulse wave DDoS: Perform DDoS in pulses
        Zero-Day DDoS
        SYN flood Attack: send large number of syn requests with fake src IP address.
        HTTP GET/POST Attack: use time delayed http headers to maintain connections, or http req with complete headers but incomplete message bodies to make the server wait.
    Ping of death Attack: Trying to crash systems by sending malformed or oversized packet

Protocol Attack: consume other resources such as connection state tables
        Fragmentation Attack: Stop victim from reassembling the packets

Application layer attack: consume resources or services of an application


Multivector Attack: Combination of all attack types.
Peer-to-Peer Attack
Permanent DOS: also known as phlashing, it sabotages system hardware
TCP SACK Panic Attack: Send SACK packet with malformed max segment size to crash linux machine. it exploits integer overflow vuln. in linux socket buffer(SKB) causing kernel panic
