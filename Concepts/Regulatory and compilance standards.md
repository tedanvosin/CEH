# Regulatory & Compliance Standards

## HIPAA

The **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** is a U.S. law designed to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge. It applies primarily to healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses.

**Key Requirements:**

- **Privacy Rule:** Establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.
- **Security Rule:** Specifies safeguards that covered entities must implement to protect electronic personal health information (e-PHI), including administrative, physical, and technical safeguards.
- **Breach Notification Rule:** Requires covered entities to notify patients and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the event of a breach involving unsecured PHI.
- **Enforcement Rule:** Provides standards for the investigations and penalties for non-compliance.

**Application:**  
HIPAA compliance is essential for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data. Organizations that fail to adhere to HIPAA requirements may face significant fines and damage to their reputation, making robust security practices and regular audits a necessity in the healthcare industry.

## PCI DSS

The **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** is a set of security requirements established to protect credit card data. It applies to any organization that accepts, processes, stores, or transmits credit card information.

**Key Requirements:**

- **Secure Network Architecture:** Install and maintain robust firewall configurations.
- **Data Protection:** Encrypt cardholder data both in storage and during transmission.
- **Vulnerability Management:** Use up-to-date antivirus software and secure systems.
- **Access Control:** Restrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel only.
- **Monitoring & Testing:** Continuously monitor networks and test security systems.
- **Security Policy:** Develop and maintain comprehensive security policies for all employees and contractors.

**Application:**  
PCI DSS compliance is critical for organizations handling payment card transactions. Adhering to these standards helps prevent data breaches, reduces the risk of fraud, and protects consumer trust while avoiding substantial fines imposed by payment card companies.

## FISMA

The **Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)** mandates that U.S. federal agencies and their contractors secure their information systems by implementing comprehensive risk management processes. Established in 2002 and later updated, FISMA requires:

- **Risk Management Framework:** Agencies must perform continuous risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities and threats.
- **Security Controls:** Implementing and maintaining a suite of security measures (administrative, technical, and physical) to protect federal information systems.
- **Regular Audits & Reporting:** Periodic evaluations and audits are required to ensure that the established controls are effective and that systems remain compliant. Agencies must submit annual reports to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) detailing their compliance status.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Establishing a continuous monitoring strategy to track security posture and rapidly respond to emerging threats.

**Application:**  
FISMA compliance ensures that federal agencies maintain a robust security posture, protecting sensitive government data and critical infrastructure. It serves as a baseline for developing and enforcing security policies, making it a cornerstone for U.S. government cybersecurity.

## GLBA

The **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)** is designed to protect the privacy of consumers' financial information by imposing obligations on financial institutions. Key components include:

- **Financial Privacy Rule:** Requires financial institutions to clearly disclose their information-sharing practices to consumers and to provide an opt-out option when information is shared with non-affiliated third parties.
- **Safeguards Rule:** Mandates that institutions develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive information security program. This program must include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect customer data against unauthorized access or use.
- **Pretexting Protection:** Prohibits the practice of pretexting, where individuals gain access to personal financial information under false pretenses, ensuring that customer data is not accessed through deceptive means.

**Application:**  
GLBA compliance is crucial for financial institutions to protect sensitive consumer information, prevent identity theft, and maintain consumer trust. By establishing robust data protection measures and clear privacy policies, GLBA helps mitigate the risk of data breaches and ensures that financial institutions uphold high standards of consumer privacy.
