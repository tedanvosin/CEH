OSINT & Recon Techniques

Google Dorking (advanced search operators for finding sensitive info)

Scanning & Network Probing Methods

Ping methods

Different Scans: TCP Connect Scan, Stealth Scan, etc.

Protocols & Services

NTP, Finger, TFTP, Kerberos

Vulnerability & Authentication Frameworks

MitreCVE (vulnerability classification)

Different types of vulnerability assessment solutions

Different types of vulnerability assessment tools

Different types of authentication protocols

Attack Techniques

LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning attacks

Tools Categorized by Use
Below are the tools grouped into categories based on how they’re used in penetration testing, forensics, reconnaissance, and more.

1. OSINT & Reconnaissance Tools
These tools and platforms help you gather information on targets (people, domains, or networks) using open-source data.

People/Entity Search:

Been Verified

Spokeo

Whitepages

ExoneraTor (tracking historical data on IPs/hosts)

Domain & Web Recon:

theHarvester

Spyse

Recon-ng

FOCA (metadata extraction)

Social & Content Intelligence:

BuzzSumo

Mention

Factiva

Specialized Search & Lookup:

Shodan (internet-connected device search)

whois

Sherlock (username enumeration)

Visualization & Data Analysis:

Maltego

Gephi

NodeXL

Web Scraping:

Octoparse

2. Network Scanning & Mapping Tools
Use these to discover hosts, open ports, and map network topologies:

hping (packet crafting)

Fing

Nmap

(Note: “Ping methods” and the various scan types are part of the conceptual framework behind these tools.)

3. Vulnerability Assessment & Scanning Tools
These tools help identify security weaknesses in systems and applications:

GFI LanGuard

OpenVAS

Nikito (likely referring to the web server scanner “Nikto”)

Qualys VM

Nessus

Xray (web vulnerability scanner)

4. Web/Application Analysis & Data Gathering
For assessing web applications and cloning/crawling sites:

BurpSuite (web app penetration testing)

HTTrack WebSite Copier

Photon

Custom scripts:

domianfy.py

mailfy.py

searchfy.py

usufy.pf

5. Password Cracking & Authentication Exploits
Tools in this category focus on recovering or cracking passwords:

Cain & Abel

John the Ripper

hashcat

L0phtCrack

6. Exploitation Frameworks & Payload Generation
These frameworks and utilities facilitate exploitation and payload crafting:

msfvenom (payload generator)

Metasploit

BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)

7. Post-Exploitation & Active Directory Tools
After gaining initial access, these tools help with lateral movement, credential dumping, and system auditing:

powerview commands (Active Directory enumeration)

linpostexp (Linux post-exploitation)

CrackMapExec (post-exploitation/lateral movement)

pwdump7 (password hash dumping)

clearev (clearing Windows event logs)

BeRoot (privilege escalation for Linux)

ntdsutil (Active Directory maintenance/forensics)

GhostPack Seatbelt (system auditing on Windows)

8. Intrusion Detection/Prevention & Monitoring Tools
These help in detecting or preventing intrusions:

KFSensor (honeypot/intrusion detection)

Zimperiums IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)

9. Additional Tools & Scripts (Miscellaneous)
Some tools either serve niche purposes or are less clearly categorized:

Binary & Dependency Analysis:

Dependency Walker

Custom/Uncertain Tools:

Vindicate

Robber

dylib hijack scanner

FaceNiff (session hijacking)

xHelper

rtgen

Other / Ambiguous:

GNUnet (secure peer-to-peer networking)

AOL (legacy service; its role might depend on context)

EZGif (online GIF editing, possibly for steganography experiments)
