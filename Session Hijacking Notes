Session Hijacking Notes
Attacker get control of a valid TCP communication session between 2 systems.

process:
    sniff
    monitor
    session desync
    session ID prediction
    command injection

Types:
    passive: Untouched traffic
    active: modifying traffic

Network level hijacking
application level hijacking

Spoofing attack: Pretending to be another user
hijacking: seizing control of active connection

UDP Hijacking: Attacker sends forged server reply to victims udp request

approaches to prevent hijacking:
HTTP Strict Transport Security
    HSTS is a web security protoccol that protects websites against MITM attacks by forcing to communicate over HTTPS
Token Binding
    when a user logs to a web app, it generates cookie with SID called token
Http Public key pinning (HPKP)
    HPKP is Trust on first use. HPKP allows a web client to assciate a specific public key certificate to particular server to minimize risk of MITM

IPsec
    Protocol for securing IP communication by authentication and encrypting each IP packet of communication session

    modes:
        Transport mode
        Tunnel mode: VPN
